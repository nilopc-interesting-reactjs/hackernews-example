# The NX components

Each component has its own folder. Every component folder has an index.js, which
adds the required logic and registers the component by name. These components are standard
[Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) and can be used by their name inside any HTML.
Components can be extended with functionality by passing middleware functions to their
`use()` method. Middlewares can be one of the standard NX middlewares, or anything else you define
with the simple `function middleware (elem, state, next) {}` syntax.

I named the folders as the name of component for easier readability.
Component folders may also include a view.html and style.css file.
They are linked together by the `nx.middlewares.render` middleware and can define
external HTML and style. Styles are scoped to the component by default and they can not
leak out of the component.

None of the above structuring and naming pattern is mandatory for NX. I just chose to follow
these conventions for this project.

This is what each of the components is responsible for.

  - [hacker-news](/src/components/hackerNews): The top level component.
  Adds some global filters and renders the main view.
  - [app-nav](/src/components/appNav): Renders the navbar view.
  - [app-router](/src/components/appRouter): A very basic router component.
  Not very interesting, for the 'router config' see the view.html of the hacker-news component instead.
  - [dynamic-html](/src/components/dynamicHTML): A component that allows
  the interpolation of any HTML into the view (not just text).
  - [story-item](/src/components/storyItem): Renders a single story item view.
  - [story-list](/src/components/storyList): Fetches and renders a list of stories.
  - [user-page](/src/components/userPage): Fetches and renders a user.
  - [comment-item](/src/components/commentItem): Renders a single comment.
  - [story-page](/src/components/storyPage): Fetches and renders a single story and
  all of its comments.
